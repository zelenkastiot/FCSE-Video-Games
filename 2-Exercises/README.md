# FCSE-Video-Games
This is the main folder that contains most of the source codes I used to solve my laboratory exercises for the fall of 2020. The descriptions of the exercises are in each of the folders and for some of the assigments I recoreded additional videos for better visual representation of the solutions. 

The videos are avilable at my YotubeChanel: :video_game: [Кирил Зеленковски](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpDat0yHNdt3VekrUEb-C_Q) :video_game:

All of the exercises are in a hronological order similar to the order they are presented at the offical page: http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/
